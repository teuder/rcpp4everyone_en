# R-like functions

Here is a list of Rcpp functions similar to R functions.

Also, if you can guarantee that `NA` is not included in the vector given to these functions, you can use `noNA()` to mark the vector. Then the functions below no longer checks for `NA`, so the calculation may speed up.

```
NumericVector res = mean(noNA(v));
```
