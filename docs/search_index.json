["index.html", "Rcpp for everyone Welcome", " Rcpp for everyone Masaki E. Tsuda 2019-10-07 Welcome Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can get high performance outcome. This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it. I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me any feedback on this document. https://github.com/teuder/rcpp4everyone_en "],

Compared with the previous standard, many new features have been added to make C++ even easier for beginners. This document will actively exploit these features of C++11. ** Important: Code examples in this document are written assuming that C++11 is enabled. ** 5.1 Enabling C++11 To enable C ++ 11, add the following description somewhere in your Rcpp code. // [[Rcpp::plugins(&quot;cpp11&quot;)]] 5.2 Recommended C++11 features 5.2.1 Initializer list Initialization of variables using {}. // Initialize Vector // The next three are the same as c (1, 2, 3).

IntegerVector v{1,2,3}; int sum=0; for(auto&amp; x : v) { sum += x; } 5.2.5 Lambda expression You can create a function object by using lambda expression. Function object are usually used as unnamed function passed to other function. Lambda expressions are written in the form [](){}. In [], you write a list of local variables you want to use in this function object. [] do not allow access to all the local variables from the function object. [=] will copy values of the all local variables to the function object. [&amp;] enables direct access to all local variables from the function object. [=x, &amp;y] means that the local variable “x” will be copied to the function object, and the local variable “y” is allowed to be accessed directly from the function object. In (), you write arguments to be passed to this function object. In {}, you describe processes you want. Return type of the lambda expression The return type of this function object is automatically set to the type of the returned value described in {}. If you want to define return type explicitly, write it like []()-&gt;int{}. Example The following example shows how to use lambda expression. You can find Some types of C++ code can be written in the same style as R.

If you want to print the values of elements of Rcpp vector using Rprintf(), you have to pass each element separately to it (see below). // [[Rcpp::export]] void rcpp_rprintf(NumericVector v){ // printing values of all the elements of Rcpp vector for(int i=0; i&lt;v.length(); ++i){ Rprintf(&quot;the value of v[%i] : %f \\n&quot;, i, v[i]); } } "],

["100_matrix.html", "Chapter 9 Matrix 9.1 Creating Matrix object 9.2 Accessing to Matrix elements 9.3 Member functions 9.4 Static member functions 9.5 Other functions related to Matrix", " Chapter 9 Matrix 9.1 Creating Matrix object Matrix object can be created in several ways. // Create a Matrix object equivalent to // m &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=2, ncol=2) NumericMatrix m1( 2 ); // m &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=2, ncol=3) NumericMatrix m2( 2 , 3 ); // m &lt;- matrix(v, nrow=2, ncol=3) NumericMatrix m3( 2 , 3 , v.begin() ); In addition, a matrix object in R is actually a vector that the number of rows and columns are set in the attribute dim. Thus, if you created a vector with attribute dim in Rcpp and return it to R, it will be treated as a matrix. // [[Rcpp::export]] NumericVector rcpp_matrix(){ // Creating a vector object NumericVector v = {1,2,3,4}; // Set the number of rows and columns to attribute dim of the vector object. v.attr(&quot;dim&quot;) = Dimension(2, 2); // Return the vector to R return v; } Execution result &gt; rcpp_matrix() [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 3 [2,] 2 4 However, even if you set a value to attribute dim of a vector object, the type of the object remains Vector type in Rcpp code. Thus, if you want to convert it to Matrix type in Rcpp, you need to use as&lt;T&gt;() function. // Set number of rows and columns to attribute dim v.attr(&quot;dim&quot;) = Dimension(2, 2); // Converting to Rcpp Matrix type NumericMatrix m = as&lt;NumericMatrix&gt;(v); 9.2 Accessing to Matrix elements By using () operator, you can get from and assign to the values of elements of a Matrix object by specifying its column number and row number. As in the case of vectors, row numbers and column numbers in Matrix start with 0. If you want to access to a specific row or column, use the symbol _. You can also use the [] operator to access an element as a vector connecting the columns of a matrix. // Creating a 5x5 numerical matrix NumericMatrix m( 5, 5 ); // Retrieving the element of row 0 and column 2 double x = m( 0 , 2 ); // Copying the value of row 0 to the vector v NumericVector v = m( 0 , _ ); // Copying the value of column 2 to the vector v NumericVector v = m( _ , 2 ); // Copying the row (0 to 1) and column (2 to 3) to the matrix m2 NumericMatrix m2 = m( Range(0,1) , Range(2,3) ); // Accessing matrix element as vector m[5]; // This points to the same element as m(0,1) 9.2.1 Accessing as reference to row, column and sub matrix Rcpp also provides types that hold “references” to specific part of a matrix. NumericMatrix::Column col = m( _ , 1); // Reference to the column 1 NumericMatrix::Row row = m( 1 , _ ); // Reference to the row 1 NumericMatrix::Sub sub = m( Range(0,1) , Range(2,3) ); // Reference to sub matrix Assigning a value to a “reference” object of a matrix is equivalent to assigning the value to its original matrix. For example, assigning a value to col will assign a value to the column 1 of m. // Reference to the column 1 NumericMatrix::Column col = m( _ , 1); // The value of the column 1 of matrix m will be doubled col = 2 * col; // Synonymous with the above example m( _ , 1) = 2 * m( _ , 1 ); 9.3 Member functions Since Matrix is actually Vector, Matrix basically has the same member functions as Vector.

The static member functions unique to Matrix are shown below. 9.4.1 Matrix::diag( size, x ) Returns a diagonal matrix whose number of rows and columns equals to “size” and the value of the diagonal element is “x”. 9.5 Other functions related to Matrix This section shows functions relating to Matrix. 9.5.1 rownames( m ) Get and set the row name of matrix m.

This is because bool type can only represent true or false, but there are three possible values TRUE,FALSE, and NA for elements of the logical vector in R. In Rcpp, TRUE is represented by 1,FALSE by 0, and NA byNA_LOGICAL (minimum value of int: -2147483648).

You can not use the return value of the all() and any() as the conditional expression of the if statement. This is because the return type of the all() and any() is not bool but SingleLogicalResult. To use the return value of the all() and any() as a conditional expression of an if statement, use the function is_true(), is_false() and is_na(). These functions convert SingleLogicalResult to bool. The code example below shows how to use the return values of the functions all() and any() as a conditional expression of an if statement. In this example, the conditional expression of all if statements will be true, and the return value of all(), any() will be displayed. // [[Rcpp::export]] List rcpp_logical_03(){ LogicalVector v1 = LogicalVector::create(1,1,1,NA_LOGICAL); LogicalVector v2 = LogicalVector::create(0,1,0,NA_LOGICAL); // Behavior of all (), any () for LogicalVector including NA is the same as R LogicalVector lv1 = all( v1 ); // NA LogicalVector lv2 = all( v2 ); // FALSE LogicalVector lv3 = any( v2 ); // TRUE // In case assigning to bool bool b1 = is_true ( all(v1) ); // false bool b2 = is_false( all(v1) ); // false bool b3 = is_na ( all(v1) ); // true // In case used in conditional expression of if statement if(is_na(all( v1 ))) { // OK Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;all( v1 ) is NA\\n&quot;; } return List::create(lv1, lv2, lv3, b1, b2, b3); } 11.3.2 ifelse() ifelse (v, x1, x2) receives the logical vector v, and returns the corresponding element of x1 when the element of v is TRUE and the corresponding element of x2 when it isFALSE.

Because the conditional expression of the C++ if statement evaluates the value of the expression as a bool type. bool type evaluates all values other than 0 as true, thus the NA of LogicalVector (NA_LOGICAL) is evaluated as true. See the following code example for how to evaluate the value of an element of LogicalVector with an if statement. // [[Rcpp::export]] LogicalVector rcpp_logical(){ // Create an integer vector containing NA IntegerVector x = {1,2,3,4,NA_INTEGER}; // The result of the comparison operation becomes LogicalVector LogicalVector v = (x &gt;= 3); // If you use the element of LogicalVector directly in the &quot;if&quot; statement // NA_LOGICAL will be evaluated as TRUE for(int i=0; i&lt;v.size();++i) { if(v[i]) Rprintf(&quot;v[%i] is evaluated as true.\\n&quot;,i); else Rprintf(&quot;v[%i] is evaluated as false.\\n&quot;,i); } // Evaluate the elements of LogicalVector for(int i=0; i&lt;v.size();++i) { if(v[i]==TRUE) Rprintf(&quot;v[%i] is TRUE.\\n&quot;,i); else if (v[i]==FALSE) Rprintf(&quot;v[%i] is FALSE.\\n&quot;,i); else if (v[i]==NA_LOGICAL) Rprintf(&quot;v[%i] is NA.\\n&quot;,i); else Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;v[&quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; &quot;] is not 1\\n&quot;; } // Displays the value of TRUE, FALSE and NA_LOGICAL Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;TRUE &quot; &lt;&lt; TRUE &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;; Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;FALSE &quot; &lt;&lt; FALSE &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;; Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;NA_LOGICAL &quot; &lt;&lt; NA_LOGICAL &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;; return v; } Execution result &gt; rcpp_logical() v[0] is evaluated as false. v[1] is evaluated as false. v[2] is evaluated as true. v[3] is evaluated as true. v[4] is evaluated as true. v[0] is FALSE. v[1] is FALSE. v[2] is TRUE. v[3] is TRUE. v[4] is NA.

["140_dataframe.html", "Chapter 12 DataFrame 12.1 Creating a DataFrame object 12.2 Accessing DataFrame elements 12.3 Member functions", " Chapter 12 DataFrame This chapter explains how to create DataFrame object, how to access its elements, and its member functions. In Rcpp, DataFrame is implemented as a kind of vector. In other words, Vector is a vector whose element is scalar value, while DataFrame is a vector whose elements are Vectors of the same length. Therefore, Vector and DataFrame have many common methods of creating objects, accessing elements, and member functions. 12.1 Creating a DataFrame object DataFrame::create() is used to create a DataFrame object. Also, use Named() or _[] if you want to specify column names when creating DataFrame object. // Creating DataFrame df from Vector v1, v2 DataFrame df = DataFrame::create(v1, v2); // When giving names to columns DataFrame df = DataFrame::create( Named(&quot;V1&quot;) = v1 , _[&quot;V2&quot;] = v2 ); When you create a DataFrame withDataFrame::create(), the value of the originalVector element will not be duplicated in the columns of the DataFrame, but the columns will be the “reference” to the original Vector. Therefore, changing the value of the original Vector changes the value of the columns. To avoid this, we use the clone() function to duplicate the value of the Vector element when creating a DataFrame column. To see the difference between using the clone() function and not using it, see the code example below. In the code example, we are creating DataFrame df from Vector v. There, column V1 is a reference to v, and column V2 replicates the value of v by the clone () function. After that, if you change to Vector v, the values of column V1 is changed, but V2 is not affected. // [[Rcpp::export]] DataFrame rcpp_df(){ // Creating vector v NumericVector v = {1,2}; // Creating DataFrame df DataFrame df = DataFrame::create( Named(&quot;V1&quot;) = v, // simple assign Named(&quot;V2&quot;) = clone(v)); // using clone() // Changing vector v v = v * 2; return df; } Execution result &gt; rcpp_df() V1 V2 1 2 1 2 4 2 12.2 Accessing DataFrame elements When accessing a specific column of DataFrame, the column is temporarily assigned to Vector object and accessed via the object. As with Vector, the DataFrame column can be specified by a numeric vector (column number), a string vector (column name), and a logical vector. NumericVector v1 = df[0]; NumericVector v2 = df[&quot;V2&quot;]; As with DataFrame creation, assigning aDataFrame column to Vector in the above way will not copy the column value to Vector object, but it will be a “reference” to the column. Therefore, when you change the values of Vector object, the content of the column will also be changed. If you want to create a Vector by copying the value of the column, use clone() function so that the value of the original DataFrame column is not changed. NumericVector v1 = df[0]; // v1 becomes &quot;reference&quot; to the 0th column of df v1 = v1 * 2; // Changing the value of v1 also changes the value of df[0] NumericVector v2 = clone(df[0]); // Duplicate the value of the element of df[0] to v2 v2 = v2*2; // Changing v2 does not change the value of df [0] 12.3 Member functions In Rcpp, DataFrame is implemented as certain kinds of vectors. In other words, Vector is a vector whose elements are scalar values, and DataFrame is a vector whose elements are Vectors. Therefore, DataFrame has many member functions common to Vector. 12.3.1 length() size() Returns the number of columns. 12.3.2 nrows() Returns the number of rows. 12.3.3 names() Returns the column name as a CharacterVector. 12.3.4 offset(name) findName(name) Returns the numerical index of the column with the name specified by the string “name”. 12.3.5 fill(v) fills all the columns of this DataFrame withVector v. 12.3.6 assign( first_it, last_it) Assign columns in the range specified by the iterators first_it and last_it to this DataFrame. 12.3.7 push_back(v) Add Vector v to the end of thisDataFrame. 12.3.8 push_back( v, name ) Append a Vector v to the end of thisDataFrame. Specify the name of the added column with the string “name”. 12.3.9 push_front(x) Append a Vector v at the beginning of thisDataFrame. 12.3.10 push_front( x, name ) Append a Vector v at the beginning of thisDataFrame.

For example, Datetime dt(10) represents the point after 10 seconds from 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. When this value is returned to R, it is displayed as the time converted to the executed time zone. For example, in Japan, Japan Standard Time (JST) is UTC + 9 hours, so Datetime d(10) will be 1970-01-01 09:00:10 JST. When creating a Datetime object in the form of Datetime dt(str, format), str is interpreted as the time in the local timezone.

These member functions also exist in all other API classes (such as NumericVector) in Rcpp. 18.1.1 inherits(str) Returns true if this object inherits the class specified by the string str. 18.1.2 slot(name) Accesses the slot specified by the character string name if this object is S4. 18.1.3 hasSlot(name) Returns true if there is a slot specified by the character string name. 18.1.4 attr(name) Accesses the attribute specified by the string name. 18.1.5 attributeNames() Return the names of all the attributes of this object as std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;. 18.1.6 hasAttribute(name) Returns true if this object has an attribute with the name specified by the string name. 18.1.7 isNULL() Returns true if this object is NULL. 18.1.8 sexp_type() Returns SXPTYPE of this object as int.

The code example below shows how to determine the type using RObject. // [[Rcpp::export]] void rcpp_type(RObject x){ if(is&lt;NumericVector&gt;(x)){ if(Rf_isMatrix(x)) Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;NumericMatrix\\n&quot;; else Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;NumericVector\\n&quot;; } else if(is&lt;IntegerVector&gt;(x)){ if(Rf_isFactor(x)) Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;factor\\n&quot;; else Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;IntegerVector\\n&quot;; } else if(is&lt;CharacterVector&gt;(x)) Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;CharacterVector\\n&quot;; else if(is&lt;LogicalVector&gt;(x)) Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;LogicalVector\\n&quot;; else if(is&lt;DataFrame&gt;(x)) Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;DataFrame\\n&quot;; else if(is&lt;List&gt;(x)) Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;List\\n&quot;; else if(x.isS4()) Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;S4\\n&quot;; else if(x.isNULL()) Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;NULL\\n&quot;; else Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;unknown\\n&quot;; } Use as&lt;T&gt;() to convert RObject to another Rcpp type after determining the type. // Converting `RObject` to `NumericVector` RObject x; NumericVector v = as&lt;NumericVector&gt;(x); "],

Thus, if you change the value of some elements in v1, the change also applied to v2. You should use clone(), if you want to avoid coupling between objects (see sample code below). The sample code presented below shows that the difference of the shallow copy and deep copy when you change value of one of vector after assigning. NumericVector v1 = {1,2,3}; // create a vector v1 NumericVector v2 = v1; // v1 is assigned to v2 through shallow copy. NumericVector v3 = clone(v1); // v1 is assigned to v3 through deep copy. v1[0] = 100; // changing value of a element of v1 // Following output shows that // the modification of v1 element // is also applied to v2 but not to v3 Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;v1 = &quot; &lt;&lt; v1 &lt;&lt; endl; // 100 2 3 Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;v2 = &quot; &lt;&lt; v2 &lt;&lt; endl; // 100 2 3 Rcout &lt;&lt; &quot;v3 = &quot; &lt;&lt; v3 &lt;&lt; endl; // 1 2 3 As explanation for people who have deeper knowledge of C++, a Rcpp object do not have value of R object (e.g. elements of a vector) itself, but have a pointer to R object. Thus, if you assign object through v2 = v1;, the value of pointer of v1 is copied to v2. So, both v1 and v2 would be pointing to the same R object. This is called “shallow copy”. On the other hand, if you assign object through v2 = clone(v1);, the value of R object that v1 is pointing is copied to v2 as new R object. This is called “deep copy”. 19.2 Data type of numerical index Maximum number of vector elements is limited to the length of 2^31 - 1 in R &lt;= version 2.0.0 or 32 bit build of R, because int is used as data type of numerical index. However, long vector is supported after 64 bit build of R 3.0.0. You should use R_xlen_t as data data type for numerical index or the number of elements to support long vector in your Rcpp code. // Declare the number of element &quot;n&quot; using R_xlen_t R_xlen_t n = v.length(); double sum = 0; // Declare the numerical index &quot;i&quot; using R_xlen_t for(R_xlen_t i=0; i&lt;n; ++i){ sum += v[i]; } 19.3 Return type of operator[] When you access to vector elements using [] or () operator, the return type is not Vector itself but Vector::Proxy. Thus, it will cause compile error when you pass v[i] directly to some function, if the function only supports Vector type. To avoid compile error v[i] assign to new object or convert it to type T using as&lt;T&gt;(). NumericVector v {1,2,3,4,5}; IntegerVector i {1,3}; // Compile error //double x1 = sum(v[i]); // Save as new object NumericVector vi = v[i]; double x2 = sum(vi); // Convert to NumericVector using as&lt;T&gt;() double x3 = sum(as&lt;NumericVector&gt;(v[i])); "],

These differences are that the function defined in Rcpp:: namespace returns a vector, while the function in the R:: namespace returns a scalar. Basically, the probability distribution functions defined in the Rcpp:: namespace has the same functionalities as those in R. So normally you can use a function in the Rcpp:: namespace, but if you want a scalar value, it is better to use that function in R:: namespace because it’s faster. The basic structures of the probability distribution functions defined in the Rcpp:: namespace are shown below. In fact, the definition of the probability distribution function of the Rcpp :: namespace is not written directly in the source code of Rcpp (because it is written using macros). But you can assume that the function is defined like as below. NumericVector Rcpp::dXXX( NumericVector x, double par, bool log = false ) NumericVector Rcpp::pXXX( NumericVector q, double par, bool lower = true, bool log = false ) NumericVector Rcpp::qXXX( NumericVector p, double par, bool lower = true, bool log = false ) NumericVector Rcpp::rXXX( int n, double par ) The basic structures of the probability distribution functions defined in the R:: namespace are shown below.

["230_R_function.html", "Chapter 23 Using R functions 23.1 Function 23.2 Environment", " Chapter 23 Using R functions In order to use R functions in Rcpp, you can use Function and Environment. 23.1 Function Using the Function class, you can call R functions from Rcpp. The argument given to the R function is determined based on position and name. Use Named() or _[] to pass a value to an argument by specifying argument name. Name() can be used in two ways: Named(&quot;argument_name&quot;, value) or Named(&quot;argument_name&quot;) = value. The code example below shows an example of calling the R function rnorm (n, mean, sd)from the function defined in Rcpp. However, when calling a package function using Function class, you have to add the package environment to the search path using the library() function in R in advance. // [[Rcpp::export]] NumericVector my_fun(){ // calling rnorm() Function f(&quot;rnorm&quot;); // Next code is interpreted as rnorm(n=5, mean=10, sd=2) return f(5, Named(&quot;sd&quot;)=2, _[&quot;mean&quot;]=10); } Execution example &gt; my_fun() [1] 8.014863 10.459980 7.741581 9.000762 11.465920 In the above example, the return type of R function called from Rcpp is assumed NumericVector. However, as in the example below, the return type of an R function called from Rcpp function is sometimes undefined. In such a case it would be better to assign the return value of the function into RObject or List element. The code below shows an example of defining simplified R function lapply() with Rcpp. // [[Rcpp::export]] List rcpp_lapply(List input, Function f) { // Applies the Function f to each element of the List input and returns the result as List // Number of elements in the List input R_xlen_t n = input.length(); // Creating a List for output List out(n); // Applying f() to each element of &quot;input&quot; and store it to &quot;out&quot;. // The type of the return value of f() is unknown, but it can be assigned to the List element. for(R_xlen_t i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) { out[i] = f(input[i]); } return out; } 23.2 Environment By using Environment class, you can retrieve objects (variables and functions) from packages and other environments. The code below shows an example of calling Matrix() function in the Matrix package. When calling a package function in this way, it is not necessary to attach the package using library() function. // [[Rcpp::export]] S4 rcpp_package_function(NumericMatrix m){ // Obtaining namespace of Matrix package Environment pkg = Environment::namespace_env(&quot;Matrix&quot;); // Picking up Matrix() function from Matrix package Function f = pkg[&quot;Matrix&quot;]; // Executing Matrix( m, sparse = TRIE ) return f( m, Named(&quot;sparse&quot;, true)); } Execution result &gt; m &lt;- matrix(c(1,0,0,2), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) &gt; rcpp_package_function(m) 2 x 2 sparse Matrix of class &quot;dsCMatrix&quot; [1,] 1 .

R Rcpp Inf R_PosInf -Inf R_NegInf NaN R_NaN On the other hand, for NA, different symbol of NA are defined for each Vector type. Vector symbol of NA NumericVector NA_REAL IntegerVector NA_INTEGER LogicalVector NA_LOGICAL CharacterVector NA_STRING The following code example shows how to use these symbols to create Vector object. NumericVector v1 = NumericVector::create( 1, NA_REAL, R_NaN, R_PosInf, R_NegInf); IntegerVector v2 = IntegerVector::create( 1, NA_INTEGER); CharacterVector v3 = CharacterVector::create( &quot;A&quot;, NA_STRING); LogicalVector v4 = LogicalVector::create( true, NA_LOGICAL); 24.2 Evaluating NA NaN Inf 24.2.1 Evaluating all the elements of a vector at once To evaluate all the NA NaN Inf -Inf elements in a vector at once, use the function is_na() is_nan() is_infinite(). In the code example below, we create a vector containing NA NaN Inf -Inf and evaluate it. From this example we can see that the is_na() evaluates both NA andNaN as TRUE (same as R’s is.na()). NumericVector v = NumericVector::create( 1, NA_REAL, R_NaN, R_PosInf, R_NegInf); LogicalVector l1 = is_na(v); LogicalVector l2 = is_nan(v); LogicalVector l3 = is_infinite(v); Rcout &lt;&lt; l1 &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;; // 0 1 1 0 0 Rcout &lt;&lt; l2 &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;; // 0 0 1 0 0 Rcout &lt;&lt; l3 &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;; // 0 0 0 1 1 You can remove NA NaN Inf from a vector by using these functions. You can also use na_omit() to remove NA. The code example below shows how to remove NA from a vector using the is_na() and na_omit(). // Creating a Vector object containg NA NumericVector v = NumericVector::create( 1, NA_REAL, 2, NA_REAL, 3); // Removeing NA from the vector NumericVector v1 = v[!is_na(v)]; NumericVector v2 = na_omit(v); 24.2.2 Evaluating single element of a vector If you want to evaluate NA NaN Inf -Inf on single element of a vector, use the static member function Vector::is_na(), traits::is_nan&lt;RTYPE&gt;(), traits:: is_infinite&lt;RTYPE&gt;(). In RTYPE, specify SEXPTYPE of the vector to be evaluated. // [[Rcpp::export]] void rcpp_is_na2() { // Creating Vector object containing NA NaN Inf -Inf NumericVector v = NumericVector::create(1, NA_REAL, R_NaN, R_PosInf, R_NegInf); // Evaluating the value for each element of the vector int n = v.length(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) { if(NumericVector::is_na(v[i])) Rprintf(&quot;v[%i] is NA.\\n&quot;, i); if(Rcpp::traits::is_nan&lt;REALSXP&gt;(v[i])) Rprintf(&quot;v[%i] is NaN.\\n&quot;, i); if(Rcpp::traits::is_infinite&lt;REALSXP&gt;(v[i])) Rprintf(&quot;v[%i] is Inf or -Inf.\\n&quot;, i); } } Here is the list of SEXPTYPE of the major Vector class.

[[1]] [1] 1 2 3 [[2]] NULL 24.4 Points to note when handling NA with Rcpp Internally NA_INTEGER and NA_LOGICAL are equivalent to the minimum value of int (-2147483648). Although, functions and operators defined in Rcpp handle the minimum value of int appropriately asNA (that is, make the result of operation on NA element as NA). Standard C++ functions and operators treat the minimum value of int as integer value. So if you add 1 to NA_INTEGER, the element is no longer minimum value of int, so it is not treated as NA. In addition, if you assign NA_LOGICAL to bool type, it will always be evaluated as true. This is because bool evaluates all numbers other than 0 as true. On the other hand, since nan and inf are defined in double, the result of the operation on nan inf in standard C ++ will be the same result as R. The table below summarizes how values are evaluated when assigning the value of NA Inf -Inf NaN to Vector or scalar type in C++. NA NaN Inf -Inf NumericVector NA_REAL R_NaN R_PosInf R_NegInf IntegerVector NA_INTEGER NA_INTEGER NA_INTEGER NA_INTEGER LogicalVector NA_LOGICAL NA_LOGICAL NA_LOGICAL NA_LOGICAL CharacterVector NA_STRING “NaN” “Inf” “-Inf” String NA_STRING “NaN” “Inf” “-Inf” double nan nan inf -inf int -2147483648 -2147483648 -2147483648 -2147483648 bool true true true true The code example below shows the difference in results when computing using the Rcpp operator and the standard C++ operator against NA_INTEGER. From this result, the operator of Rcpp evaluates the result of the operation on NA as NA, but you can see that the standard C++ operator treats NA_INTEGER as just a integer value. // [[Rcpp::export]] List rcpp_na_sum(){ // Creating an integer vector containing NA IntegerVector v1 = IntegerVector::create(1,NA_INTEGER,3); // Applying the &quot;+&quot; operator between vector and scalar defined in Rcpp IntegerVector res1 = v1 + 1; // Applying the &quot;+&quot; operator between int and int defined in standard C++ IntegerVector res2(3); for(int i=0; i&lt;v1.length(); ++i){ res2[i] = v1[i] + 1; } // Outputing the result as named list return List::create(Named(&quot;Rcpp plus&quot;, res1), Named(&quot;C++ plus&quot;, res2)); } Execution result &gt; rcpp_na_sum() $`Rcpp plus` [1] 2 NA 4 $`C++ plus` [1] 2 -2147483647 4 "],
